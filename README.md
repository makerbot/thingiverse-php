## Thingiverse
A PHP wrapper for the Thingiverse API.

### Motivation
Making awesome things easier!

## Use
### Configuration
1. Login at http://www.thingiverse.com/developers
2. Click on your app, then 'Edit this app'
3. In the thingiverse.php `__construct()` method, enter your Client ID and Client Secret (from the Thingiverse.com app page) into `$this->client_id` and `$this->client_secret`
4. Optionally enter your URL for Thingiverse to forward the user (and OAuth code) to in `$this->redirect_uri`

### Implementation
1. Import thingiverse.php `require_once 'thingiverse.php';`
2. Create a new instance `$thingiverse = new Thingiverse();`. Optionally enter an access token (if you have it) as a parameter (skip the next two steps if you do this)
3. Use `$thingiverse->makeLoginURL();` to create a link to authorize a user account for your app
4. Once you receive a code from Thingiverse, `$thingiverse->oAuth('code here');`
5. You're all set!
